trying to make tool compatible with python 3
LOGGING changes!


put parentheses on all print statements
Changed error message to throw exception if not python 3

# Define the full sequence with no splice sites
--> 355                                 final_seq = seq[relative_seq_start:relative_seq_end]

These aren't integers, so I changed how they're calculated
changed / to // when ambiguous

I think it's working
--comparison using default parameters seems to produce the same output

NOT FULLY TESTED FOR DIFFERENT INPUTS AND PATHS
The only thing I didn't test for was differences in unicode versus ascii encoding of strings and some differences in int versus long encoding of numbers. I think those should be ok though in this context.

Tested on dog and human, and on running the script for folder with dog and human

COMPARE THE CONTENT OF TWO FOLDERS
diff -s ./data_py2/ ./data_py3/

command to run within ipython (shell for python 3)
ipython
run pevk_finder_v_1.py -i ./ttn_seqs/Dog_ttn.fasta -w 10 -r .54 -l 12 -o ./data/

command to run in python 2
python pevk_finder_v_1.py -i ./ttn_seqs/Dog_ttn.fasta -w 10 -r .54 -l 12 -o ./data/

I think this is now compatible with both py2 and py3

Maybe need to add some future stuff??
look at this article:
